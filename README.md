This repo contains the data and code to caluclate quantitative activity from GE Starguide SPECT phantom scans.

For this scan protocol, 67.5mCi of Lu177 was placed in a phantom with water volume of 5.6L. The phantom was scanned for 3 minutes and for 10 minutes (1 bed position) at three timepoints 0Hr post injection, 24Hr post injection, 96Hr post injection. A CT was aquired at each timepoint.

Refer to the [dose](dose.ipynb) notebook for loading the scans and converting them to quantitative units.
